# Climate variability modes verification

Verification of seasonal forecasting of climate variability modes (North Atlantic Oscillation, East Atlantic, East Atlantic / Western Russia and Scandinavian Pattern).

The calculation of the verification scores is based on the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) [Seasonal Forecast Verification Tutorial](https://ecmwf-projects.github.io/copernicus-training-c3s/sf-verification.html).

## Index

* 1-Box_calc: Verification of seasonal forecasting of North Atlantic Oscillation calculated as the difference between the normalized anomaly of sea level pressure between a South-Atlantic and a North-Atlantic lat-lon box. The methodology is based on Baker et al., 2018.
* 2-EOFs_calc: Verification of seasonal forecasting of North Atlantic Oscillation, East Atlantic, East Atlantic / Western Russia and Scandinavian Pattern calculated with an Emprirical Orthogonal Function analysis. The methodology is based on Lledó et al., 2020.
* 3-Common_plots: Scripts for representing verification score-cards, with all variability modes and both of the above-mentioned methodologies.
