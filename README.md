# Verification of C3S seasonal forecasting systems

We show the performance of 8 different seasonal forecasting systems in reproducing seasonal climatology in the Iberian Peninsula and climate variability modes.

The calculation of the verification scores is based on the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) [Seasonal Forecast Verification Tutorial](https://ecmwf-projects.github.io/copernicus-training-c3s/sf-verification.html).

## Index

* 1-Sf_variables: Verification of seasonal forecasting of surface variables (2m temperature, total precipitation and mean sea level pressure) for the Iberian Peninsula.
* 2-Pl_variables: Verification of seasonal forecasting of pressure level variables (u-wind, v-wind, geopotential height) for the Iberian Peninsula.
* 3-Var_modes: Verification of seasonal forecasting of climate variability modes (North Atlantic Oscillation, East Atlantic, East Atlantic / Western Russia and Scandinavian Pattern).
* 0-Visualization: Html interface for an interactive visualization of results.
