                Accurate seasonal forecasts can be very useful for taking adaptation and prevention measures in the face of unfavourable weather conditions, such as droughts, heat waves, excessive rainfall, extreme fire risk conditions, etc. In a region with a very marked seasonal cycle and a high inter-annual variability of atmospheric conditions such as the Iberian Peninsula, the demand for improved seasonal forecasting becomes even more compelling.

                Currently operational seasonal forecasting systems have considerable margin for improvement in their ability to predict mid-latitude temperature or precipitation. However, some of these systems have shown some skill in predicting, months in advance, the phase of some variability modes such as the North Atlantic Oscillation.

                Here we show an analysis of the skill of 8 seasonal forecasting systems in reproducing winter surface variables and modes of variability.

                The calculation of the verification scores and some of the graphic representations are based on the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) <a href="https://ecmwf-projects.github.io/copernicus-training-c3s/sf-verification.html">Seasonal Forecast Verification Tutorial</a>.
